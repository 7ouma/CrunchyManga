Crunchyroll Manga Downloader v0.4 Beta (CrunchyManga v0.4 Beta for short).
What's new in this version?

* This version is a new one made from scratch, so some features like Download volumes, complete mangas, packs and CLI are not working yet.

* This version downloads only individual chapters so far, I hope to finish it soon.

* Several bugs have been fixed (it may still have some bugs left in the script).

Remember, this is a Beta! if you want to use all features get the buggy v0.3.2. Some things may change in the stable and the next version.
